[Project website](https://monitorito.github.io/)

This repository contains Monitorito, a browser extension capable of capturing the requests being made by your browser and generating a graph network to visualise it. This graph can be used for various purposes, but the original intention was performing analyses around tracking, privacy and security. There are additional functionalities for manipulating the graph, such as:
- filtering parts of the graph
- clustering different nodes into a single node
- expanding domain nodes to observe the internal resources of specific domains.

Finally, the user can export all the data captured (either the raw requests and redirects captured) or the generated graph in **[.csv]** files to import them in other analytics tools.

- Select the subfolder **_app_** of the repo

### Testing
To execute the unit tests, open the file **_test/index.html_** in your browser. If you also want to see the code coverage of each different component of the application, you will have to transfer the whole repository to a web server (Apache, Nginx etc.) and visit the **_<APPLICATION_HOME>/test_** url in your browser, to access the file via a web browser. Then, click the button “Enable coverage” in the visited webpage.
